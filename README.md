# TFM-Detection-and-Localization-of-GNSS-Radio-Interference-using-ADS-B-Data
Here I pretend to develop the simulation to calculate the position of the interference between GNSS and ground station in order to determine the position of the planes. 
No I have created a new brach to include the calculations with the module numpy and to include a better modelization of the Earth.
